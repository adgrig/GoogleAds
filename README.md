## Highlight Google Ads - just like a couple of years ago

The repo contains 2 files - nothing fancy. 
A zip file (**google_ads_highlighter.zip**) with a small Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script to highlight ads on Google Search 
and another zip file (**GoogleAdsStyler.zip**) containing an unpacked Chrome/ Chromium extension that does the same thing.
